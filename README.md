[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

In the root of your project, run the following:

`npm i`

Then run `grunt` to build the project.

## Development

In your wp-content/themes folder you will now have a folder with the name of your theme which is setup with the basics to get a theme off the ground quickly. In the root of your newly created theme you'll have the following grunt tasks you can run:

    grunt # runs the default task that builds the assets

    grunt watch # watches for any changes to scss files.
